Make recommendations for items a user may want to buy based on their current shopping list to identify items they may want to add, increase app engagement, and ultimately increase order size.

Increase app engagement, identify missing items, and ultimately increase order size

Increase order size by using recommendations from the user?s current shopping list to suggest missing items or items that the user may want to try, and make adding such items to the shopping list highly accessible to the user


# Success criteria: 
A set of metrics for tracking adoption of recommender?s suggestions as well as overall performance of recommendation system*
