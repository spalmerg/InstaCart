# Project Charter: 3rd-Party App Plugin for Instacart 
Make recommendations for items a user may want to buy based the item they just added to their shopping cart. Ideally this will identify items they may want to add, increase app engagement, and ultimately increase order size.   


# Vision: 
Increase app engagement, identify missing items, and ultimately increase order size 


# Mission: 
Increase order size by using recommendations from the users current shopping list to suggest missing items or items that the user may want to try, and make adding such items to the shopping list highly accessible to the user
